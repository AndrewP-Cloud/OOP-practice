This project was originally completed for a class my final semester of college. It was my
second OOP java programming classer, but was much simpler and focused on the OOP principles
more than the computer science that was focused in my programming for engineers class.

The intentions of this were to demonstrate I understand the basic principles of OOP programing
and to help me warm up before tackling my next project. An application built on the .Net stack.
